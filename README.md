# Slacker

Homework made in WPF C# for uni. The goal was to create a to-do list app with multiple root to-do lists and sub to-do lists.

Each to-do list has a name and an icon.

Each to-do list can have tasks with a name, status, priority, deadline, done date, and a category. You can create different categories and assign them to tasks.

You can also search for specific tasks by name or by deadline.

Everything gets saved in a `.slkr` file which is a simple XML file. No Microsoft account is needed and no data can be stolen from you (you will have to take care of the file on your own).
